# Narcissistic (Armstrong) number

My 6th task for google code-in 2019.
A program in rust which checks whether a number given is an Narcissistic (Armstrong) number or not.
for example:-
9 is an Narcissistic (Armstrong) number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9
10 is not an Narcissistic  (Armstrong) number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1
